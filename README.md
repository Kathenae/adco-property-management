# Project Overview:

We are a real estate management company seeking an experienced backend developer to create a simple yet effective real estate data repository. goal is to build an internal tool to organize and filter property listings, facilitating quick and efficient access to real estate data for our staff. This project will be developed in phases, with the initial focus on creating an internal property database and matching system, followed by potential landlord access and future expansion into a public-facing platform.

Additionally, the database must be accessible via mobile devices through a web app or similar solution, allowing our team to access property data on the go. We do not require a native mobile app, but mobile compatibility is essential.

## Project Phases:

### Phase 1: 
- Internal Property Database

 - Property Listings Storage & Management: A centralized database for storing property details (location, size, price, contact info, etc.).

- Matching System: A search feature that matches client requests to property listings based on filters (e.g., location, size, price).

- Mobile Access: The system must be accessible through mobile devices via a web app or responsive interface, ensuring easy access to property listings on the go.

### Phase 2: 
- Expanding the Database & Adding Landlord Access

- Landlord Membership Model: Allow landlords to upload and manage their property listings for a fee through limited access.

### Phase 3: Future Expansion (Optional)

- Public Access: Potential development into a public-facing website or app to allow clients to search listings directly.
